# TraceFinder: AI-Powered Forensic Scanner Identification üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**TraceFinder** is a web application that identifies the source scanner used to create a digital image. By analyzing the unique, invisible artifacts and noise patterns left by a scanner's hardware, our machine learning model can trace an image back to its origin device. This has powerful applications in digital forensics, document authentication, and evidence verification.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Scanner Identification**: Upload a scanned image and instantly get a prediction of the probable source scanner model.
* **Confidence Score**: Each prediction is accompanied by a confidence score to indicate the model's certainty.
* **Forensic Analysis**: Based on the principle that every scanner leaves a unique "fingerprint" like noise or texture traces.
* **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Visualizes which parts of the image were most influential in the model's decision using techniques like Grad-CAM.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application follows a sophisticated machine learning pipeline to ensure accurate identification.

1.  **Image Input**: A user uploads a scanned image through the web interface.
2.  **Preprocessing**: The image is standardized by resizing, denoising, converting to grayscale, and normalizing pixel values.
3.  **Feature Extraction**: The system extracts scanner-specific features, including Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU), wavelet transforms (`haar`, `sym2`), and other texture descriptors.
4.  **ML/DL Classification**: A pre-trained classifier (CNN, SVM, or Random Forest) analyzes the features to match them with a known scanner profile.
5.  **Prediction Output**: The model returns the most likely source scanner model and a confidence score.
